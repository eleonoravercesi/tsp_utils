Several routines I commonly use when working with TSP instances. Still very preliminary and in progress.

## For my future self
- Do not use the Conda base environment to install PySCIPOpt.
- https://pyscipopt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html#conda
- Command I used from an existing Conda env:
```bash
conda env update --file env.yml --prune
```

# TODO 
- Check if the env.yml really work 
- Something weird with Conda env and dependecies
